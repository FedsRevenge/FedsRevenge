## About me and what I do

My name is Tom, I'm 43, work at a factory making 3-phase distribution transformers.
I've always wanted to learn how to code, seems it's much easier today than it was when I was a teenager.

Currently, I'm taking Angela Yu's 100 days of Python course, when writing this I'm at day 30.
I've also read "Automate the Boring Stuff" by Al Sweigart and "Crash Course in Python" by Eric Matthes.

Both books are great and cover the subject from different views, Automate the boring stuff is a book you can read wherever and whenever while Crash Course is a more code while you read approach.

Currently most or all of my repositories are private because I have a silly idea I can make money on it.
I also make some programs just to keep coding and learning.

## Projects I'm working on: :factory_worker:
 - [X] Core cutting program creator for a Georg TBA-300 RobotLine core cutting line, more or less finished.
 - [X] Winding program creator for Ruff LW-120 RW wire winding machines.
